# Concatenation

In Python, an f-string is a way to format strings where you can directly embed expressions inside curly braces ({}) within the string. The letter "f" before the opening quote of the string indicates that it is an f-string. These expressions will be evaluated and the results will be inserted into the string when it is created. It allows you to easily combine variables and other expressions with your text without the need for multiple string concatenations.
