# Character Generator

You will need to:

Ask your users a series of questions that identify if they're one of the characters in the world you have created.
Organize your questions and potential answers before you start to more easily identify how to code it.

Add multiple if statements to check the result of each question.
Use input and variables to ask the questions, but ask each question only before the next if statement.

Make sure to have a final print if they haven't selected any of the characters so far.
