## GPT Prompt

I am writing writing a band name generator. The program should ask the user for the city they grew up in and the name of a pet.  It should then combine the two and print the band name. The program should also print a greeting. Make sure the input cursor shows on a new line.

Create a python program that will accomplish the task.  Add comments around every line and provide
a separate unit test file.  The unit test file should test every function in the program. The unit test file should be named test_band_name.py and the program file should be named band_name.py.  The program should be able to be executed at the command line. The program should be able to be tested by running python test_band_name.py at the command line. The program should be able to be imported by running import band_name.py at the python command line.
