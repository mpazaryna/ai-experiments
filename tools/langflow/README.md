# langflow

Langflow is an easy way to prototype LangChain flows. The drag-and-drop feature allows quick and effortless experimentation, while the built-in chat interface facilitates real-time interaction. It provides options to edit prompt parameters, create chains and agents, track thought processes, and export flows.

## Install issue

I had to run the following to get langflow installed.

```sh
export HNSWLIB_NO_NATIVE=1 
```

## Running

```sh
langflow run     
```
