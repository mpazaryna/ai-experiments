The snake will be controlled using the arrow keys.\n2. The snake will grow by one unit each time it eats food.\n3. The game will end if the snake hits the wall or its own body.\n4. The food will be randomly placed within the game area, and will not overlap with the snake's body.\n\nGiven these assumptions, we will need the following core classes, functions, and methods:\n\n1. `Snake` class: This will represent the snake itself. It will have methods for moving, growing, and checking for collisions with itself.\n2. `Food` class: This will represent the food that the snake eats. It will have methods for being eaten and being placed in a new location.\n3. `Game` class: This will represent the game as a whole. It will have methods for starting, ending, and running the game loop.\n4. `Controller` class: This will handle user input to control the snake.\n5. `View` class: This will handle rendering the game to the screen.\n\nNow, let's start with the \"entrypoint\" file, `main.py`, and then go to the ones that are imported by that file.\n\nmain.py\n```python\nfrom game import Game\n\ndef main():\n    game = Game()\n    game.run()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\ngame.py\n```python\nfrom snake import Snake\nfrom food import Food\nfrom controller import Controller\nfrom view import View\n\nclass Game:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.snake = Snake()\n        self.food = Food()\n        self.controller = Controller(self.snake)\n        self.view = View(self.snake, self.food)\n\n    def run(self):\n        while True:\n            self.controller.handle_input()\n            self.snake.move()\n            if self.snake.check_collision():\n                break\n            if self.snake.eat(self.food):\n                self.food.place()\n            self.view.render()\n```\n\nsnake.py\n```python\nclass Snake:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.body = [(0, 0)]\n        self.direction = (0, 1)\n\n    def move(self):\n        head = self.body[0]\n        new_head = (head[0] + self.direction[0], head[1] + self.direction[1])\n        self.body.insert(0, new_head)\n        self.body.pop()\n\n    def grow(self):\n        self.body.append(self.body[-1])\n\n    def check_collision(self):\n        return self.body[0] in self.body[1:]\n\n    def eat(self, food):\n        if self.body[0] == food.position:\n            self.grow()\n            return True\n        return False\n```\n\nfood.py\n```python\nimport random\n\nclass Food:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.position = (0, 0)\n        self.place()\n\n    def place(self):\n        self.position = (random.randint(0, 10), random.randint(0, 10))\n```\n\ncontroller.py\n```python\nimport pygame\n\nclass Controller:\n    def __init__(self, snake):\n        self.snake = snake\n\n    def handle_input(self):\n        for event in pygame.event.get():\n            if event.type == pygame.QUIT:\n                pygame.quit()\n                quit()\n            elif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:\n                if event.key == pygame.K_UP:\n                    self.snake.direction = (0, -1)\n                elif event.key == pygame.K_DOWN:\n                    self.snake.direction = (0, 1)\n                elif event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:\n                    self.snake.direction = (-1, 0)\n                elif event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:\n                    self.snake.direction = (1, 0)\n```\n\nview.py\n```python\nimport pygame\n\nclass View:\n    def __init__(self, snake, food):\n        self.snake = snake\n        self.food = food\n        pygame.init()\n        self.screen = pygame.display.set_mode((800, 600))\n\n    def render(self):\n        self.screen.fill((0, 0, 0))\n        for segment in self.snake.body:\n            pygame.draw.rect(self.screen, (255, 255, 255), pygame.Rect(segment[0]*20, segment[1]*20, 20, 20))\n        pygame.draw.rect(self.screen, (255, 0, 0), pygame.Rect(self.food.position[0]*20, self.food.position[1]*20, 20, 20))\n        pygame.display.flip()\n```\n\nrequirements.txt\n```\npygame==2.0.1\n```\n\nThis code should be fully functional, assuming that the pygame library is installed and that the game is run in an environment where a pygame window can be displayed.
