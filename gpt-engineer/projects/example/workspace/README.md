Based on the requirements and the traditional rules of the snake game, we will make the following assumptions:

1. The snake will be controlled using the arrow keys.
2. The snake will grow by one unit each time it eats food.
3. The game will end if the snake hits the wall or its own body.
4. The food will be randomly placed within the game area, and will not overlap with the snake's body.

Given these assumptions, we will need the following core classes, functions, and methods:

1. `Snake` class: This will represent the snake itself. It will have methods for moving, growing, and checking for collisions with itself.
2. `Food` class: This will represent the food that the snake eats. It will have methods for being eaten and being placed in a new location.
3. `Game` class: This will represent the game as a whole. It will have methods for starting, ending, and running the game loop.
4. `Controller` class: This will handle user input to control the snake.
5. `View` class: This will handle rendering the game to the screen.

Now, let's start with the "entrypoint" file, `main.py`, and then go to the ones that are imported by that file.
