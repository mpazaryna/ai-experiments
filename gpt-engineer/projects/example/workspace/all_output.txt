Based on the requirements and the traditional rules of the snake game, we will make the following assumptions:

1. The snake will be controlled using the arrow keys.
2. The snake will grow by one unit each time it eats food.
3. The game will end if the snake hits the wall or its own body.
4. The food will be randomly placed within the game area, and will not overlap with the snake's body.

Given these assumptions, we will need the following core classes, functions, and methods:

1. `Snake` class: This will represent the snake itself. It will have methods for moving, growing, and checking for collisions with itself.
2. `Food` class: This will represent the food that the snake eats. It will have methods for being eaten and being placed in a new location.
3. `Game` class: This will represent the game as a whole. It will have methods for starting, ending, and running the game loop.
4. `Controller` class: This will handle user input to control the snake.
5. `View` class: This will handle rendering the game to the screen.

Now, let's start with the "entrypoint" file, `main.py`, and then go to the ones that are imported by that file.

main.py
```python
from game import Game

def main():
    game = Game()
    game.run()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

game.py
```python
from snake import Snake
from food import Food
from controller import Controller
from view import View

class Game:
    def __init__(self):
        self.snake = Snake()
        self.food = Food()
        self.controller = Controller(self.snake)
        self.view = View(self.snake, self.food)

    def run(self):
        while True:
            self.controller.handle_input()
            self.snake.move()
            if self.snake.check_collision():
                break
            if self.snake.eat(self.food):
                self.food.place()
            self.view.render()
```

snake.py
```python
class Snake:
    def __init__(self):
        self.body = [(0, 0)]
        self.direction = (0, 1)

    def move(self):
        head = self.body[0]
        new_head = (head[0] + self.direction[0], head[1] + self.direction[1])
        self.body.insert(0, new_head)
        self.body.pop()

    def grow(self):
        self.body.append(self.body[-1])

    def check_collision(self):
        return self.body[0] in self.body[1:]

    def eat(self, food):
        if self.body[0] == food.position:
            self.grow()
            return True
        return False
```

food.py
```python
import random

class Food:
    def __init__(self):
        self.position = (0, 0)
        self.place()

    def place(self):
        self.position = (random.randint(0, 10), random.randint(0, 10))
```

controller.py
```python
import pygame

class Controller:
    def __init__(self, snake):
        self.snake = snake

    def handle_input(self):
        for event in pygame.event.get():
            if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
                pygame.quit()
                quit()
            elif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
                if event.key == pygame.K_UP:
                    self.snake.direction = (0, -1)
                elif event.key == pygame.K_DOWN:
                    self.snake.direction = (0, 1)
                elif event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:
                    self.snake.direction = (-1, 0)
                elif event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:
                    self.snake.direction = (1, 0)
```

view.py
```python
import pygame

class View:
    def __init__(self, snake, food):
        self.snake = snake
        self.food = food
        pygame.init()
        self.screen = pygame.display.set_mode((800, 600))

    def render(self):
        self.screen.fill((0, 0, 0))
        for segment in self.snake.body:
            pygame.draw.rect(self.screen, (255, 255, 255), pygame.Rect(segment[0]*20, segment[1]*20, 20, 20))
        pygame.draw.rect(self.screen, (255, 0, 0), pygame.Rect(self.food.position[0]*20, self.food.position[1]*20, 20, 20))
        pygame.display.flip()
```

requirements.txt
```
pygame==2.0.1
```

This code should be fully functional, assuming that the pygame library is installed and that the game is run in an environment where a pygame window can be displayed. The game will run in an infinite loop until the snake collides with itself, at which point the game will end.
